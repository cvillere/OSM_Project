#Guide To Project Files

##Python Files

--All python files, with the exception of project_source_code,
are from the accompanying course lessons. They were included at
the suggestion of the project submission guidelines.

The project_source_code is the code used in the ipython Notebook to
create the project.


##Sample.OSM File

--This file is a small sample of the Raw XML OSM file I used to complete
my project. This was included so my reviewer could validate my code.


##Project Notebook

--I used an ipython notebook to complete the project because it allowed me
to see my code and the output all in the same place. This was tremendously
helpful as I did lots of code reworking based upon the output.

--I did not use any sort of special environment for the project.
I simply used the default Anaconda environment with the packages I loaded inside of the notebook.
